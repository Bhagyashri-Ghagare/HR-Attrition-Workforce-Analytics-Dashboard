🧠 HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations because it increases hiring costs and affects productivity.
This project focuses on analyzing why employees leave the company and identifying key patterns behind attrition using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The goal of this project is to help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to understand:

Which employees are leaving?

Which departments have the highest attrition?

What factors (salary, age, tenure, satisfaction) influence employee turnover?

Without proper analysis, HR teams cannot design effective retention strategies.
This dashboard answers these questions using real HR data.

📊 Key Insights & Storytelling
🔹 1. Overall Attrition Trend

The dashboard shows total employees, total attrition, and attrition rate.
This provides a quick overview of workforce stability and turnover severity.

Insight:
Higher attrition indicates the need for improved employee engagement and retention strategies.

🔹 2. Department-wise Attrition

Certain departments such as Sales and R&D show higher attrition rates.

Insight:
Workload, pressure, or role expectations may be causing employees to leave these departments more frequently.

🔹 3. Age & Gender Patterns

Younger employees (20–30 years) have a higher attrition rate compared to senior employees.

Insight:
Young professionals may leave due to career growth opportunities, salary expectations, or job dissatisfaction.

🔹 4. Salary Impact on Attrition

Employees with lower salary ranges show higher attrition.

Insight:
Compensation is a key factor in employee retention, especially for entry-level employees.

🔹 5. Tenure (Years at Company)

Employees with less than 2 years of experience have the highest attrition.

Insight:
This suggests onboarding challenges or job role mismatches for new hires.

🔹 6. Job Satisfaction & Performance

Employees with lower satisfaction scores are more likely to leave the company.

Insight:
Employee engagement and satisfaction programs can significantly reduce attrition.

💡 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, organizations can:
